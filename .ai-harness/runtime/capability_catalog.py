"""Small, deterministic catalog for selecting the minimum useful agent capabilities.

The catalog borrows the useful architectural idea of a typed agent catalog: specialists have
explicit responsibilities, mutability and report contracts. It intentionally does not depend on
an agent framework. The provider remains responsible for execution; this module only decides what
kind of work is justified and makes that decision inspectable.
