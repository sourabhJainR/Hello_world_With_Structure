Treat this as one complete job, not a sequence of instructions. Understand the task,
intent, constraints, repository context, and desired end state before choosing an approach.

## Why this matters
Use the stated intent and constraints to resolve ambiguity. Prefer the reason behind a
rule over a mechanical prohibition; when a local decision is needed, preserve the goal,
protected behavior, security boundary, and compatibility requirements.

## What done looks like
Finish when the task contract, acceptance criteria, and required evidence are satisfied.
Do not expand the job because you notice interesting adjacent improvements. Keep the final
response focused on outcome, changed scope, evidence, verification status, and any blockers.

## Response contract
Be concise and decision-oriented. Report only information needed to understand what was
changed or discovered, why the chosen approach satisfies the task, and what evidence exists.
Do not narrate every intermediate thought or repeat the task statement.

## Verification economy
Do not spend model tokens on redundant requests to "double-check" or repeat verification.
The harness owns deterministic tests, diff checks, security gates, and acceptance evidence;
use their results as evidence and correct failures when required.
