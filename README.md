# Adaptive AI Coding Orchestrator

A provider-neutral AI software-engineering control plane for Claude Code and compatible coding agents. **AER (Adaptive Engineering Runtime)** turns a task, bug, review, research question, Jira issue, or proof of concept into a repository-aware workflow with bounded context, capability routing, verification, review, durable evidence, graph orchestration, regression replay, and evidence-backed learning.

## What AER is today

The repository now has one coherent execution path from task intake through verification, learning, memory consolidation, empirical tuning, and controlled improvement.

```text
Task / Intent
    |
    v
Context + Repository Intelligence
    |
    v
Cognitive Plan / Capability Routing
    |
    v
StateGraph / Agent Team
    |
    v
Verify -> Review -> Evidence
    |
    v
Record Experience
    |
    v
Continuous Maintenance Lane
    |
    +--> consolidate memory
    +--> replay / evaluate history
    +--> tune strategy + confidence
    +--> tune iteration target
    |
    v
Advisory policy for future tasks
```

The important architectural boundary is that **execution remains bounded and policy-gated** while learning is durable and continuous. The maintenance lane never mutates an active task's policy mid-run; learned changes are applied to future work after evidence and regression gates pass.

## Canonical ownership boundaries

| Area | Canonical owner |
|---|---|
| Dependency planning | `portable.task_planner.TaskPlan` |
| Graph execution | `portable.agency_state_graph.StateGraph` |
| Agent-team orchestration | `.ai-harness/runtime/graph_agent_team.py` |
| Capability semantics and routing | `portable.agent_capabilities` / `CapabilityFabric` |
| Durable memory | `portable.agent_capabilities.PersistentMemory` |
| Repository retrieval | `portable.agency_codebase_context.CodebaseIndex` and `portable.repo_intelligence.RepositoryMap` |
| Scheduling and run claims | `portable.automation_scheduler.AutomationScheduler` |
| Adaptive learning | `portable.adaptive_learning.AdaptiveLearningStore` |
| Empirical tuning | `portable.adaptive_tuning.AdaptiveTuner` |
| OS service lifecycle | `portable.maintenance_service` |
| Local bounded execution | `portable.local_offload.LocalOffloadBroker` |

Compatibility surfaces adapt to these owners instead of maintaining independent state.

See [`docs/CAPABILITY_MEMORY_OWNERSHIP.md`](docs/CAPABILITY_MEMORY_OWNERSHIP.md) for the capability/memory contract and [`docs/RIPWIRE_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/RIPWIRE_INTEGRATION.md) for repository-intelligence design lineage.

## Deterministic repository intelligence

AER builds one deterministic repository snapshot and reuses it for multiple structural questions.

```bash
python -m portable.repo_intelligence . --for="Fix the authentication timeout regression" --token-budget=4000
python -m portable.repo_intelligence . --mode=callers --symbol="authenticate"
python -m portable.repo_intelligence . --mode=impact --symbol="authenticate" --graph-depth=1
python -m portable.repo_intelligence . --mode=tests --symbol="authenticate"
python -m portable.repo_intelligence . --mode=situ --base=HEAD
python -m portable.repo_intelligence . --mode=pack-task --for="Add retry handling to the payment client"
```

The map provides deterministic file ordering and SHA-256 identity, symbol/import/call relationships, bounded graph expansion, explicit token budgets, affected-test candidates, parser-error disclosure, skipped-file disclosure, and explicit unknowns when evidence is incomplete.

Repository intelligence accelerates context discovery; verification, policy, review, regression, permissions, and release gates remain authoritative.

## Graph orchestration and agent teams

AER includes a dependency-free `StateGraph` runtime inspired by durable agent-graph patterns without taking a LangGraph runtime dependency. It provides state snapshots, reducers, conditional routing, bounded retries, checkpoints, interrupts, deterministic traces, bounded supersteps, and explicit parallel-safety controls.

`GraphAgentTeam` uses that graph runtime while retaining `TaskPlan` as the canonical dependency contract:

```text
TaskPlan
   |
   v
Dependency graph
   |
   +--> independent read-only agents -- bounded parallel supersteps
   |
   +--> mutating agents ------------ serialized execution
   |
   v
SharedTaskMemory
   |
   v
Verification / review / synthesis
```

Dependency failures are fail-closed. Read-only roles receive an explicit `patch_allowed: false` guard. The graph path is the default; `AER_GRAPH_TEAM=0` remains available for diagnostics and compatibility.

### Local resource offload

The graph/team layer can use an additive `LocalOffloadBroker` for independent local work that should not occupy the coordinator context. It detects CPU capacity, bounds concurrency, applies time/output budgets, scrubs secret-like environment variables, and can run jobs in temporary workspace copies. The broker is an execution resource, not a second orchestrator or policy owner.

```bash
python -m portable.local_offload --project-root . --workers 3 -- pytest -q
```

See [`docs/LOCAL_OFFLOAD.md`](docs/LOCAL_OFFLOAD.md) for the API and safety model.

## Engineering lifecycle and evidence

For substantial work the control plane follows one evidence lineage:

```text
research -> plan -> implement -> verify -> review -> shadow -> canary -> promote
                                                            |
                                                            +-> rollback
```

`ContextEvidence` is immutable. Verification creates a `VerificationReceipt`; review binds evidence to the same artifact and verification result. Shadow and canary require the appropriate prior receipts. Promotion requires matching evidence and can be rolled back.

The state-ledger flow is:

```text
INTENT
  -> CONTRACT
  -> REPO_FACTS
  -> DECISIONS
  -> EVIDENCE
  -> CHANGESET
  -> VERIFY
  -> OUTCOME
  -> OPEN_RISKS
  -> NEXT
```

## Continuous learning and self-improvement

Every completed task can become an experience record. The learning path is deliberately separated from the active worker path:

```text
experience
   -> deferred learning
   -> memory consolidation
   -> rolling benchmark history
   -> empirical comparison
   -> confidence calibration
   -> strategy / iteration tuning
   -> advisory policy
   -> future task
```

The current adaptive tuner maintains durable history and policy state. Promotion is bounded by observation counts, independent-task counts, confidence-adjustment limits, iteration floors/ceilings, and evidence requirements.

The maintenance lane is intentionally outside active orchestration. It claims one scheduled run, processes deferred learning, evaluates the longer history, writes a maintenance receipt, and releases the durable scheduler claim.

## Continuous maintenance service

`portable.maintenance_service` is the OS lifecycle wrapper for the existing maintenance lane. The scheduler remains the source of truth; the service does not create a second learning store or scheduler.

### Default schedule

The default maintenance schedule is the **last calendar day of every month at 02:00 local time**. The time, timezone, project root, polling interval, budget, enablement, and service scope are configurable.

Configuration defaults:

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| Schedule | Last day of every month |
| Time | `02:00` |
| Timezone | `local` |
| Poll interval | `60` seconds |
| Maintenance budget | `20` jobs |
| Service scope | `user` |
| Enabled | `true` |

The durable scheduler retains claim-before-run semantics and records run outcomes. Existing interval-based schedules remain compatible. The previously-created adaptive-learning five-minute schedule is migrated once to the monthly cadence instead of being deleted, preserving its run history.

### Foreground mode

Useful for development and validation:

```bash
python -m portable.maintenance_service --project-root /path/to/repo run
```

Run one maintenance attempt without entering a long-running loop:

```bash
python -m portable.maintenance_service --project-root /path/to/repo run-once
```

### Environment configuration

```bash
export AER_PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/repo
export AER_MAINTENANCE_TIME=02:00
export AER_MAINTENANCE_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata
export AER_MAINTENANCE_POLL_SECONDS=60
export AER_MAINTENANCE_BUDGET=20
export AER_MAINTENANCE_ENABLED=1
export AER_SERVICE_SCOPE=user
```

The scheduler itself stores the calendar policy in its durable task record, so service restarts do not reset the monthly schedule.

### Linux: systemd

Install the user service:

```bash
python -m portable.maintenance_service --project-root /path/to/repo --scope user install
```

Install as a system service when elevated service scope is required:

```bash
sudo python -m portable.maintenance_service --project-root /path/to/repo --scope system install
```

Manage it with:

```bash
python -m portable.maintenance_service --scope user status
python -m portable.maintenance_service --scope user start
python -m portable.maintenance_service --scope user stop
python -m portable.maintenance_service --scope user uninstall
```

The generated unit runs the existing Python maintenance host, restarts on failure, and keeps the calendar decision in AER's durable scheduler.

### macOS: launchd

Install the per-user launch agent:

```bash
python3 -m portable.maintenance_service --project-root /path/to/repo --scope user install
```

For a system daemon, use the `system` scope with the privileges required by the target machine:

```bash
sudo python3 -m portable.maintenance_service --project-root /path/to/repo --scope system install
```

Manage it with:

```bash
python3 -m portable.maintenance_service --scope user status
python3 -m portable.maintenance_service --scope user start
python3 -m portable.maintenance_service --scope user stop
python3 -m portable.maintenance_service --scope user uninstall
```

### Windows: Windows Service

Windows Service mode uses `pywin32` because a Python process must integrate with the Windows Service Control Manager rather than behave like a plain console process.

```powershell
python -m pip install pywin32
python -m portable.maintenance_service --project-root C:\path\to\repo --scope system install
```

Manage it with:

```powershell
python -m portable.maintenance_service --scope system status
python -m portable.maintenance_service --scope system start
python -m portable.maintenance_service --scope system stop
python -m portable.maintenance_service --scope system uninstall
```

The service starts automatically and waits efficiently for the durable monthly schedule rather than running a second scheduler.

### Service safety rules

The service only owns lifecycle and execution of the already-gated maintenance lane. It does not change credentials, permissions, merge authority, security policy, or active task policy. A failed maintenance cycle remains retryable through the scheduler's claim/run ledger instead of being silently discarded.

## AER CLI and portable distribution

The GitHub Actions `aer-portable` artifact is self-contained and includes both the outer `aer_cli.py` launcher and `aer-portable.zip`.

```bash
python aer_cli.py aer-portable.zip
```

On success, AER is installed under user-scoped `~/.aer` storage.

Build and verify a bundle locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sourabhJainR/Hello_world_With_Structure.git
cd Hello_world_With_Structure
python aer_cli.py build --output aer-portable.zip
python aer_cli.py verify aer-portable.zip
```

AER records a provenance chain:

```text
semantic version -> exact source Git commit -> bundle SHA-256
```

The installed machine state is kept under:

```text
~/.aer/versions/v<version>/
~/.aer/current
~/.aer/current/install.json
~/.aer/active.json
~/.aer/automation/automation.db
~/.aer/memory/memory.db
```

Execution journals, telemetry, caches, worktrees, and Python caches remain outside the portable distribution.

## Repository isolation and safety

Installing, updating, or rolling back AER does not:

- add AER distribution files to the target repository;
- modify project source, tests, manifests, or configuration merely to install AER;
- modify Git remotes, hooks, branches, or ignore rules;
- silently modify MCP configuration, credentials, permissions, production access, or merge authority;
- allow learned behavior to weaken immutable safety or security controls.

When AER performs a user-requested engineering task, project changes are the requested engineering changes, not AER distribution artifacts.

## Capability roles

| Role | Typical use |
|---|---|
| Planner | Break down substantial implementation work |
| Explorer | Trace repository structure and dependencies |
| Researcher | Gather external/domain evidence when permitted |
| Builder | Implement requested code/configuration/test changes |
| Verifier | Run and interpret deterministic verification |
| Reviewer | Check correctness, compatibility, quality, and maintainability |
| Security reviewer | Examine elevated-risk changes and boundaries |
| RCA investigator | Diagnose without patching when investigation-only work is requested |
| Synthesizer | Combine evidence, decisions, unresolved risks, and next action |

Independent read-only work can be parallelized. Mutating agents are serialized behind declared dependencies.
