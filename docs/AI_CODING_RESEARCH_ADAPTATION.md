# AI Coding Research Adaptation

AER should learn from the engineering system around the model, not only from model outputs. This note records the research/practice bytes currently adapted into the runtime and skill.

## Evidence lanes

### 1. System reliability, not model score alone

Recent reliability synthesis treats coding agents as systems composed of model, harness, execution state, retrieval, memory, permissions, evaluation and observability. AER therefore records trajectory, graph digest, environment fingerprint, evidence and evaluator outcomes and uses layered gates.

Adapted:
- durable execution trajectory
- environment fingerprint
- evidence ledger
- layered verification
- explicit safety boundary for candidate execution

### 2. Continual learning

SWE-Bench-CL frames software engineering as an evolving stream rather than isolated tasks and recommends measuring forgetting, forward/backward transfer and tool-use efficiency. AER therefore keeps regression families and learning signals instead of optimizing only the latest task.

Adapted:
- learning signal per run
- transfer key
- repair/failure/attempt metrics
- regression-family mindset
- protection against overfitting to one successful task

### 3. Continuous integration and maintenance

SWE-CI evaluates agents over long repository evolution and repeated CI rounds. AER therefore treats regression replay and repository-native validation as durable parts of the learning loop rather than a final test pass.

Adapted:
- repeated regression replay
- long-horizon maintenance evaluation
- acceptance plus maintainability signals
- learning from later regressions

### 4. Realistic requests

RealSWE reports that real user prompts are often short and informal and that desired behavior and motivation can materially affect performance. AER therefore builds a minimal task contract and preserves desired behavior/motivation instead of stuffing every available repository detail into context.

Adapted:
- GOAL / REQUIREMENTS / ACCEPTANCE contract
- desired behavior and motivation capture
- targeted evidence retrieval
- context economics

### 5. Refactoring and repository-scale work

Recent benchmark work emphasizes large refactoring, integration and maintenance because one-shot issue resolution can hide failures. AER therefore evaluates graph-level changes, compatibility, regression paths and structure, not just whether one test passes.

Adapted:
- graph digest
- architecture review
- compatibility checks
- characterization/invariant/metamorphic/property-based checks when useful

### 6. Environment and sandbox controls

Current coding-agent practice puts substantial weight on sandboxing, constrained execution, telemetry and explicit boundaries. AER follows the same separation: candidate source is statically inspected without execution; candidate behavior must execute inside the designated evaluation boundary before promotion.

Adapted:
- side-effect-free static candidate validation
- forbidden dangerous constructs in candidate source
- regression and safety gates
- atomic promotion
- rollback lineage

## Self-improvement rule

AER is allowed to improve its own executable orchestration:

`Outcome -> Learning Signal -> Candidate -> Static Validation -> Regression -> Safety -> Shadow -> Canary -> Promote -> Monitor -> Rollback`

The learning engine may change routing, graph topology, node selection, retry/repair strategy and retrieval strategy. It may not grant itself credentials, permissions or security exemptions.

Research is used as engineering input, not as a claim that a particular technique is universally optimal. AER should continue to re-evaluate these practices against its own regression corpus and production outcomes.
