# Memory lifecycle

The memory system is deliberately split into three layers so execution context does not rot.

## 1. Private working memory

`portable.agent_memory.AgentMemory` belongs to one agent and one run. It is bounded, disposable working state. It is never implicitly promoted to team knowledge.

## 2. Shared task memory

`SharedTaskMemory` contains only bounded handoffs needed by the current dependency graph. It is not a transcript. Old entries are evicted and the context engine selects only task-relevant items.

## 3. Durable learning ledger

`.ai-harness/runtime/task_memory.py` is the durable, portable backend. SQLite is used from the Python standard library with WAL, transactions, busy timeouts and a process lock. An append-only JSONL audit file preserves the full recorded observations.

Every observation carries a schema version, learning version, revision, task, outcome, category, approach, detail, command, run, source agent, evidence and promotion state. `candidate` is the safe default. `verified` is reserved for curated knowledge.

## Dreaming

Dreaming is a post-run lifecycle, not an execution step. `portable.dream_memory.DreamMemory` reads observations after the execution graph has finished and curates repeated outcomes. The analysis never enters the execution prompt.

A repeated successful approach can become verified reusable guidance. Repeated failed/regressed approaches can become verified anti-patterns. Conflicting outcomes remain candidates and are not promoted.

The promotion threshold is deterministic and model-independent. Better models can improve the quality of the observations and the steward's analysis without changing the memory safety boundary.

## Guardrails

- Execution agents focus on the task, not memory administration.
- Private memory is run-scoped and bounded.
- Working context is bounded before it reaches any model.
- Durable learning is not copied from raw transcripts.
- Candidate learning is not trusted as verified truth.
- Conflicting evidence is not promoted.
- Durable writes are concurrency-safe and idempotent.
- The audit trail is append-only; curated learning can be superseded rather than silently rewritten.
- Repository files, tests and other source evidence remain the source of truth.
- Dreaming can become richer over time without increasing the execution prompt size.

## Improvement loop

```text
Run N
  -> execute focused task
  -> capture evidence/outcome
  -> steward records candidate observations
  -> dream cycle analyzes after execution
  -> repeated evidence becomes verified learning

Run N+1
  -> retrieve only relevant verified learning + relevant failures
  -> execute with a better starting point
  -> validate inherited learning
  -> record new evidence
  -> dream again
```

This makes improvement cumulative while keeping execution context small.
