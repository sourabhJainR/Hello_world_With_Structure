# Self-Improving Control Loop Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Strengthen AER's existing context, decision, verification, graph, and learning spine into a deterministic self-improving control loop without introducing competing authorities.

**Architecture:** Extend `CodebaseIndex`, `TaskPlan`, the canonical engineering-state decision records, `StateGraph`, verification, and `agency_adaptive_planning`. Context stays derived from repository truth; decisions stay inside the canonical engineering-state ledger; learning remains advisory.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3, JSON Schema, pytest, existing AER portable runtime and GitHub Actions harness.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-self-improving-control-loop-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Preserve one canonical owner per concern.
- Do not add a second repository graph, evidence store, workflow engine, memory store, planner, or capability catalog.
- Keep portable code provider-neutral and dependency-light.
- Learning cannot authorize actions, bypass verification, or weaken release gates.
- Probabilistic model output is never equivalent to verified fact.
- Preserve backward compatibility for existing public APIs unless a test proves a bug in their current contract.
- Use deterministic serialization and deterministic ordering for persisted/runtime decisions.
