# Harness Scenarios

This example is a small, safe reference application for exercising the current AER control-plane behavior. The application remains independent of `.ai-harness`; these scenarios describe what a harness run should produce around the application.

## Scenario 1: Complete-job change

**Intent**

Add a `remove(name)` operation to `HabitTracker` that removes an existing habit and raises `KeyError` when the habit does not exist.

**Rationale**

The example should support the full lifecycle of a habit, including explicit removal, without changing unrelated behavior.

**Done criteria**

- `remove(name)` deletes the requested habit.
- Removing an unknown habit raises `KeyError`.
- Existing add, record, active, and streak behavior remains unchanged.
- Regression tests cover success and failure paths.

**Guardrails**

- Change only the habit-tracker example.
- Do not add external services or dependencies.
- Do not change the harness runtime.

**Non-goals**

- Persistence.
- Authentication.
- Changes to the family-financial-register example.

**Expected run behavior**

The harness should produce the run-scoped chain:

`intent.md -> spec.md -> plan.md -> changeset -> verification -> review -> proof`

The intent should remain immutable; verification should be deterministic and authoritative.

## Scenario 2: Material ambiguity

Prompt: `Improve habit deletion.`

Expected behavior: return `CLARIFICATION_NEEDED` before making a change because the request does not establish whether deletion should remove one habit, clear completion history, or delete all habits.

The harness should not guess a destructive interpretation.

## Scenario 3: Scope fence

Prompt: `Add persistence to the habit tracker and also update the AER runtime to support it.`

Expected behavior: keep the requested application scope separate from the core runtime. The runtime change is out of scope unless explicitly approved as a new intent. Record the out-of-scope work as deferred rather than silently expanding the run.

## Scenario 4: Script-first deterministic work

Prompt: `Validate that all example Python files compile and report failures.`

Expected behavior: route the repeatable mechanical check to a deterministic script or existing repository validation command rather than asking a model to inspect every file manually. Record command inputs, result digest, exit status, and duration in the execution evidence.

## Scenario 5: Verification and proof

After Scenario 1, run the example tests and inspect the resulting diff. A passing model response is not proof. Proof should be tied to deterministic test output and the final changeset, with the relevant artifact digests recorded where supported by the harness.
